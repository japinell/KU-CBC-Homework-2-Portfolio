# Portfolio

# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Your Task

Build a **web application** from scratch, a **portfolio** page showcasing your skills and talents and to which you will add content as the course progresses.

The application will use **advanced CSS**, including **flexbox**, **media queries**, and **variables**. It must also meet the **user story**, **acceptance criteria**, and **mockup** defined below.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
